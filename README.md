Autobud Grow Manager(AGM) is an IoT device that fully manages the growth of plants. AGM can be run on both off the shelf wifi switches with ESP82xx chips, as well as nodemcu or other ESP82xx boards. The controller was designed to be both automated as well as customizable based on specific use cases. The device can receive input from external IoT devices and carry out actions based on received data.

ABG is essentially an automation relay engine. Its primary purpose is to carry out watering and lighting operations based on where the plant(s) are in their growth cycle.

This device can be scaled from a home grow enclosure or spacebucket  of a single plant, to an entire garden of crops. It is designed to dump data to APIs linked to a database or just run locally.
